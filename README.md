# My reflections

## What I learnt

I learnt more about:
- Responsiveness
- Flex and grid
- Animations and transitions
- Git and GitHub

## My biggest challenge
The two biggest challenges for me was:
- Firstly to get it fully responsive. I did manage okay, but could definitaly have done it more effectively. 
- Secondly it was to get the parallax effect to work. I knew how I wanted it to look, but for me, it was not a very straight forward markup and css

When I got stuck I googled/AI:d or asked classmates to get myself out of the problem, but I was careful to always try to understand the solution

## What I'm proud about
Im proud about how I challenged myself and used techniques I didnâ€™t know existed before
